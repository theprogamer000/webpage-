						<h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Kia ora, 你好, Namaste, Hello. People address me as Jerry Zheng.<br> I was born on the first of June in 2009.<br> I migrated to New Zealand around a decade ago as an international student,<br> I mostly did my studies in New Zealand and now I am a student that is part of Botany Down Secondary College.<br> I always aim for the best grade for academics and promise myself to be more enthusiastic towards academics. <br>

My goal is to be successful in academics.<br> As a result, I could study as a medical student and become a doctor.<br> The ways I could achieve this is being harder working and persistent.  </p>
					
						<h2>Culture</h2>
					     <p>
	
						I was born in China, and I moved to New Zealand 11 years ago I migrated here due to Chinas Economic was not great at that time since New Zealand was offering a lot of job opportunities.<br> As I love my cultural heritage, it has many traditions and fun activities all over the country.  
						</p>
						
						<h2>Hobbies</h2>
						<p>I have a lot of hobbies in general, such as badminton and volleyball. <br>Mostly I am at home just studying and playing games,<br> and some games include storylines which are very inspiring and amazing on the graphics since the game has excellent models, color, shade, shadow, meshes and many more.<br> However, what makes me the most satisfied is completing the work as some work can be stressful and once you are done,<br> you feel relaxed and calm. </p>
